# Description
This is my first ever website! This website explores the life-cycle of a super high mass star; built as a physics project to teach future students. 
This website helped me learn CSS transitions and animations along with OOP using Javascript.

## How to use 
There are 6 stages that you can navigate through using the arrows on the screen.
On the bottom there is an additional small arrow which provides information on the current star cycle.
